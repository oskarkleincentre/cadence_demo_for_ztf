## [animation of Sky SN and the ZTF survey](./two_nights_march.mp4) :

__Description:__ This animation made by Raul Biswas at OKC shows the motion of the ZTF field of view in different filters across the sky over a period of two consecutive nights in the month of March. The pointings are  based on a realitic scheduler simulation output from Eric Bellm (UW). The title indicates the night (since the first night of the science survey)  and the local time of observation. The bright spots are Type Ia supernoave, bright enough to be above detection threshold fro ZTF. They are sampled from a simulation catalog made by Ulrich Feindt at OKC. The size (area) of the points being related to the apparent brightness at the time of observation, while the color indicates the redshift of the points. The scaling is such that one can see points which are at the ZTF five sigma depth of 20.5 in any of the three bands. The white dotted lines show the approximate region of the Milky Way which is the observing target of rich galactic science, but obscures the extra-galactic sky of cosmological supernovae.
