## [animation of Sky SN and the ZTF survey](./two_nights_march.mp4) :

__Description:__ This animation shows the motion of the ZTF field of view in different filters across the sky over a period of two consecutive nights in the month of March based on an example scheduler output from Eric Bellm. The caption shows the night (since the first night of the science survey)  and the local time of observation. The spots are SNIa from Uli's simulated catalog with the size (area) of points being related to the apparent brightness at the time of observation, while the color indicates the redshift of the points. The scaling is such that one can see points which are at the ZTF five sigma depth of 20.5 in any of the three bands. The white dotted lines show the approximate region of the Milky Way which is the observing target of rich galactic science, but obscures the extra-galactic sky of cosmological SN.
